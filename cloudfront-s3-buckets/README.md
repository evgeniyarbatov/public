# Host multiple static websites on S3

Terraform scripts to use the same domain name for hosting multiple sites on S3.

Use this when you need to host unrelated sites created with different frameworks.

## How to use

Check `setup` on the scripts to do the initial setup and creating the buckets.

Use `update` to update existing S3 sites.
